              The B.E. Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering is a
              comprehensive four-year program that imparts a well-rounded
              education and a strong foundation in electronics, communications,
              computing, and engineering sciences. Established in 2005, the
              department initiated the Electronics & Telecommunication
              Engineering Course with an intake of 60 students and later
              introduced M.E. (EXTC) in 2010 with 18 students. The faculty,
              equipped with high qualifications and professional expertise,
              conducts training programs covering Network Administration,
              Communication, Design & Optimization, Network Security, Embedded
              Systems, Real-time DSP applications, VLSI design, and RTOS. The
              department collaborates with companies like Tata Consultancy
              Services and Sony Ericsson India Ltd through MoUs to enhance
              students' technical knowledge. Faculty members actively engage in
              R&D, publishing research in prestigious international journals and
              conferences such as IEEE, IET, AIP, ASP, Elsevier, etc. Students
              stay informed through organizations like IEEE, IETE, and F.E.T.S.
              Graduates find opportunities in communication, networking, and
              technology-driven fields. Companies such as Sony Ericsson India
              Ltd, CISCO, Microsoft, IBM, Deloitte, L&T, Tech Mahindra, Infosys,
              etc., recruit our students on campus.

              The Department of Electronics and telecommunication was
              established in 2005 which offers B. Tech. degree in Electronics
              and Telecommunications Engineering with a dream to provide a broad
              liberal education as well as to impart both knowledge, and skills
              to strengthen the foundation in engineering sciences, mathematical
              and scientific fundamentals and to gain expertise in various
              domains of electronics, communications, computing. This dream
              achieved a new pedestal when the first batch of students of
              Masters in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering started
              in the academic year 2010 with an intake of 18 students. The
              department is currently scaling new heights with the launch of a
              Ph.D. program in 2012.
